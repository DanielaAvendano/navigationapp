# Navigationapp
Tutorial to practice react-navigation with bare ReactNative.

In this project: 
1. Learned how to use basic react-navigation libraries following the getting started guides : https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started.
2. Adding the StackNavigator and native Drawer and make the app navigation roadmap.
3. After that I added BottomTabs.
